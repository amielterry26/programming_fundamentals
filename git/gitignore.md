# .gitignore Guide
___

## Why Use a `.gitignore` File?

- **Keeps Repos Clean**: Excludes non-essential files, like system or editor files, from version control.
- **Protects Sensitive Data**: Prevents accidental commits of sensitive files (e.g., credentials, private keys).
- **Optimizes Repo Size**: Ignores large or autogenerated files, reducing repository size.
- **Simplifies Collaboration**: Reduces conflicts over machine-specific or temporary files.

## Basic Syntax

- Each line is a pattern for a file or directory to ignore.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments.
- `*` matches any string, so `*.log` ignores all `.log` files.
- `!` negates a pattern, meaning files can be explicitly included if ignored by a prior rule.

### Example Patterns
```plaintext
# Ignore all log files
*.log

# Ignore all files with .tmp extension
*.tmp

# Ignore a specific directory
/temp/

# Ignore .env but keep .env.example
.env
!.env.example
```
